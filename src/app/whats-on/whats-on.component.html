    <!-- Parents and carers bring their children on Tuesdays from 10 till 11.30 during school term time.
      
      Start with crafts, painting and lots of toys to share!
      Enjoy drinks and a biscuit,  and time to meet others and make new friends.
      There will be a story from the Bible and a song time.
      If you are new and would like to come, please use this form to ensure there are places available. -->
